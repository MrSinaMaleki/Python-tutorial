# Python Basics Tutorial: Getting Started with Python

## Introduction to Python

Welcome to this Python Basics tutorial! In this guide, you will learn what Python is, a bit about its history, why it is popular, and how to write your first Python program. Whether you’re new to programming or new to Python, this tutorial will help you get started.

## 1. What is Python?

Python is a programming language that is easy to read and learn. It can be used for many tasks, such as:

- Building websites
- Analyzing data
- Automating tasks
- Creating software
- Working with artificial intelligence

Because of its simple style, Python is a great choice for beginners, and many people around the world support each other in learning it.

## 2. Overview and History

Python was created by Guido van Rossum and first released in 1991. It was built to be clear and simple. Over time, Python has become one of the most popular programming languages because it is easy to learn and use.

## 3. Python’s Philosophy and Community

Python follows a set of ideas called the "Zen of Python." Two key points are:

- "Beautiful is better than ugly."
- "Simple is better than complex."

The Python community is friendly and helpful, with many resources available to support you as you learn.

## 4. Why Learn Python?

Here are some good reasons to learn Python:

- **Many Uses:**  
  You can use Python for web development, data analysis, automating tasks, and more.
  
- **Easy for Beginners:**  
  Its simple style makes it a great starting point for new programmers.
  
- **Lots of Tools:**  
  There are many libraries and frameworks available that help you build projects quickly.

## 5. Python 2 vs. Python 3

- **Python 2:**  
  Released in 2000, this version is now old and no longer supported.
  
- **Python 3:**  
  Released in 2008, this is the current version. It has better support for different characters and overall improvements. For any new projects, always choose Python 3.

## 6. Setting Up Your Environment

### Installing Python

1. **Download Python:**  
   Visit [python.org/downloads](https://www.python.org/downloads/) and download the latest version of Python 3 for your computer.
   
2. **Installation:**  
   Run the installer and follow the instructions. If you are using Windows, be sure to check the option to add Python to your system’s PATH.

## 7. Your First Python Script

Let’s write your first Python program—the classic "Hello, World!" script.

### Writing the Script

1. Open your editor (you can choose one later if you haven't already).
2. Type the following code:

    ```python
    print("Hello, World!")
    ```

This command tells Python to show the message "Hello, World!" on your screen.

### Running the Script

1. **Save Your File:**  
   Save the file as `hello_world.py`.
   
2. **Run the Script:**  
   - **Using the Command Line:**  
     Open your terminal or command prompt, go to the folder where you saved your file, and run:
     
     ```bash
     python hello_world.py
     ```
     
   - **Using Your Editor:**  
     Many editors have a "Run" button to execute your code.

When you run the script, you should see "Hello, World!" appear on your screen.

### Choosing Your Editor: Installing PyCharm

If you haven’t chosen an editor yet, you might want to try PyCharm. Here’s how to get started with PyCharm:

1. **Download PyCharm:**  
   Go to [JetBrains PyCharm Download](https://www.jetbrains.com/pycharm/download/).  
   - Choose the **Community** version, which is free and perfect for beginners.

2. **Install PyCharm:**  
   - Run the downloaded installer.
   - Follow the on-screen instructions to install PyCharm on your computer.
   - Once installed, open PyCharm, and create a new project. You can then create a new Python file (like `hello_world.py`) and start coding.
